Changelog
=========


Version 0.12
------------

Released 2021-05-05

- Switched to using Python's logging mechanism directly, with different
  log levels. Removed function ``util.log``.

- Made the application's log level configurable.

- Introduced an internal queue to decouple syslog message reception from
  message formatting and posting to IRC.

- Added TCP support for syslog message receiving. Adjusted routes
  configuration format to support it.

- Added support for custom IRC commands to send after connecting
  (authentication, cloaking, flood protection, etc.) (idea and essential
  patch provided by Jonas Alexandersson).

- Prevent enabling of a joined IRC channel to receive messages if no
  ports are routed to it.

- Remove leading and trailing newlines from message text to prevent
  additional lines on IRC (patch provided by Jonas Alexandersson).

- Provided and documented an easier way to customize message formatting.


Version 0.11
------------

Released 2021-04-21

- Introduced configuration file. Removed the CLI arguments that have
  been replaced by it.

- Moved configuration of IRC channels to join and ports-to-channels
  routes to configuration file.

- Provided an actual ``syslog2irc`` command.

- Published the package to the Python Package Index to allow installing
  from there.

- Added support for IRC server password.

- Added support for a rate limit for the IRC connection, i.e. the
  maximum number of messages per second to send. This can prevent the
  bot from getting kicked (or even banned) from a channel because of
  flooding.

- Added ``Dockerfile``.

- Added command line option ``--version`` to show syslog2IRC's version.
